        Work impacts every aspect of life, from the economy to communities,
        family and health. The At Work 2023 workplace trends report featuring,
        Envoy's proprietary platform data looked at more than 31 million
        workplace entries around the globe, adding to the conversation around
        workplace solutions that build better workplace experiences. In the
        world of positive psychology, motivation helps us adapt, function
        productively and maintain well-being in the face of opportunities and
        threats. Whether it's professional development, remote work or burnout,
        we are preparing to fail if we don't know what motivates our employees
        and how to apply that motivation. According to Leesman, offices work
        well when they embrace informality, visibility and connection. When
        evaluating your workplace's effectiveness, be mindful of your employee's
        unique needs and recent life roles like parenting or caregiving. There
        are also varying generational office expectations and usages. To provide
        the best tools, resources and spatial environment, you will also want to
        examine and deeply understand what your employees do in their roles and
        work activities and what's in the pipeline. Cities Cities experience the
        same seasonality pattern, with attendance dips around the summer and
        winter holidays. However, Dallas and Atlanta had slower growth rates in
        workplace traffic, and DC and NYC had growth rates far surpassing other
        US metro areas. Team using the most desks Some job functions are better
        equipped to work remotely. Others are more dependent on onsite
        collaboration and tools or in industries like healthcare or
        manufacturing, where they depend on the workplace to do their jobs. The
        most common teams to book desks onsite: Engineering made up a quarter of
        bookings (26%). HR and Operations teams booked the least amount of
        desks. These teams are better enabled to perform their job functions
        remotely. Finance (19%), IT (15%), Sales (14%), and Marketing (13%).
        These teams rely on collaboration and being in the office to work on
        their projects. They may also need special equipment that is only
        available in the office. Going back to IT, the bootcamp market, which
        teaches people to code, is booming with a market size of 418.08 million
        in 2022 with forecasted growth of 12.27% CAGR from 2022 to 2030– to more
        than US $1 billion. And did you know, according to a study, 4% of
        non-tech workers have now learned to code? These career opportunities
        will, in turn, impact what will and won't work in the future of office
        usage and functionality. As we undergo rapid technology, skill and
        economic changes, organizations need leaders and managers to create
        great workplaces to help reduce stress and combat burnout through
        holistic strategies. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my

        In the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry
        4.0), the digital world has a wealth of data, such as Internet of Things
        (IoT) data, cybersecurity data, mobile data, business data, social media
        data, health data, etc. To intelligently analyze these data and develop
        the corresponding smart and automated applications, the knowledge of
        artificial intelligence (AI), particularly, machine learning (ML) is the
        key. Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised,
        unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the
        area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of
        machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large
        scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine
        learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and
        the capabilities of an application. Thus, this study’s key contribution
        is explaining the principles of different machine learning techniques
        and their applicability in various real-world application domains, such
        as cybersecurity systems, smart cities, healthcare, e-commerce,
        agriculture, and many more. We also highlight the challenges and
        potential research directions based on our study. Overall, this paper
        aims to serve as a reference point for both academia and industry
        professionals as well as for decision-makers in various real-world
        situations and application areas, particularly from the technical point
        of view. We live in the age of data, where everything around us is
        connected to a data source, and everything in our lives is digitally
        recorded [21, 103]. For instance, the current electronic world has a
        wealth of various kinds of data, such as the Internet of Things (IoT)
        data, cybersecurity data, smart city data, business data, smartphone
        data, social media data, health data, COVID-19 data, and many more. The
        data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, discussed
        briefly in Sect. “Types of Real-World Data and Machine Learning
        Techniques”, which is increasing day-by-day. Extracting insights from
        these data can be used to build various intelligent applications in the
        relevant domains. For instance, to build a data-driven automated and
        intelligent cybersecurity system, the relevant cybersecurity data can be
        used [105]; to build personalized context-aware smart mobile
        applications, the relevant mobile data can be used [103], and so on.
        Thus, the data management tools and techniques having the capability of
        extracting insights or useful knowledge from the data in a timely and
        intelligent way is urgently needed, on which the real-world applications
        are based. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly, machine learning
        (ML) have grown rapidly in recent years in the context of data analysis
        and computing that typically allows the applications to function in an
        intelligent manner [95]. ML usually provides systems with the ability to
        learn and enhance from experience automatically without being
        specifically programmed and is generally referred to as the most popular
        latest technologies in the fourth industrial revolution (4IR or Industry
        4.0) [103, 105]. “Industry 4.0” [114] is typically the ongoing
        automation of conventional manufacturing and industrial practices,
        including exploratory data processing, using new smart technologies such
        as machine learning automation. Thus, to intelligently analyze these
        data and to develop the corresponding real-world applications, machine
        learning algorithms is the key. The learning algorithms can be
        categorized into four major types, such as supervised, unsupervised,
        semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning in the area [75], discussed
        briefly in Sect. “Types of Real-World Data and Machine Learning
        Techniques”. The popularity of these approaches to learning is
        increasing day-by-day, which is shown in Fig. 1, based on data collected
        from Google Trends [4] over the last five years. The x-axis of the
        figure indicates the specific dates and the corresponding popularity
        score within the range of to has been shown in y-axis. According to Fig.
        1, the popularity indication values for these learning types are low in
        2015 and are increasing day by day. These statistics motivate us to
        study on machine learning in this paper, which can play an important
        role in the real-world through Industry 4.0 automation. In general, the
        effectiveness and the efficiency of a machine learning solution depend
        on the nature and characteristics of data and the performance of the
        learning algorithms. In the area of machine learning algorithms,
        classification analysis, regression, data clustering, feature
        engineering and dimensionality reduction, association rule learning, or
        reinforcement learning techniques exist to effectively build data-driven
        systems [41, 125]. Besides, deep learning originated from the artificial
        neural network that can be used to intelligently analyze data, which is
        known as part of a wider family of machine learning approaches [96].
        Thus, selecting a proper learning algorithm that is suitable for the
        target application in a particular domain is challenging. The reason is
        that the purpose of different learning algorithms is different, even the
        outcome of different learning algorithms in a similar category may vary
        depending on the data characteristics [106]. Thus, it is important to
        understand the principles of various machine learning algorithms and
        their applicability to apply in various real-world application areas,
        such as IoT systems, cybersecurity services, business and recommendation
        systems, smart cities, healthcare and COVID-19, context-aware systems,
        sustainable agriculture, and many more that are explained briefly in
        Sect. “Applications of Machine Learning”. Based on the importance and
        potentiality of “Machine Learning” to analyze the data mentioned above,
        in this paper, we provide a comprehensive view on various types of
        machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the
        intelligence and the capabilities of an application. Thus, the key
        contribution of this study is explaining the principles and potentiality
        of different machine learning techniques, and their applicability in
        various real-world application areas mentioned earlier. The purpose of
        this paper is, therefore, to provide a basic guide for those academia
        and industry people who want to study, research, and develop data-driven
        automated and intelligent systems in the relevant areas based on machine
        learning techniques. The key contributions of this paper are listed as
        follows: To define the scope of our study by taking into account the
        nature and characteristics of various types of real-world data and the
        capabilities of various learning techniques. To provide a comprehensive
        view on machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the
        intelligence and capabilities of a data-driven application. To discuss
        the applicability of machine learning-based solutions in various
        real-world application domains. To highlight and summarize the potential
        research directions within the scope of our study for intelligent data
        analysis and services. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
        The next section presents the types of data and machine learning
        algorithms in a broader sense and defines the scope of our study. We
        briefly discuss and explain different machine learning algorithms in the
        subsequent section followed by which various real-world application
        areas based on machine learning algorithms are discussed and summarized.
        In the penultimate section, we highlight several research issues and
        potential future directions, and the final section concludes this paper.

        Io experiences tidal deformation due to its eccentric orbit around
        Jupiter, which provides a primary energy source for Io’s ongoing
        volcanic activity and infrared emission1. The amount of tidal energy
        dissipated within Io is enormous and has been hypothesized to support
        the large-scale melting of Io’s interior and the formation of a global
        subsurface magma ocean. If Io has a shallow global magma ocean, its
        tidal deformation would be much larger than in the case of a more rigid,
        mostly solid interior2. Here we report the measurement of Io’s tidal
        deformation, quantified by the gravitational tidal Love number k2,
        enabled by two recent flybys of the Juno spacecraft. By combining
        Juno3,4 and Galileo5-7 Doppler data from the Deep Space Network and
        astrometric observations, we recover Re(k2) of 0.125±0.047 (1σ) and the
        tidal dissipation parameter Q of 11.4±3.6 (1σ). These measurement
        confirm that a shallow global magma ocean in Io does not exist and are
        consistent with Io having a mostly solid mantle2. Our results indicate
        that tidal forces do not universally create global magma oceans, which
        may be prevented from forming due to rapid melt ascent, intrusion, and
        eruption8,9, so even strong tidal heating – like that expected on
        several known exoplanets and super-Earths10 – may not guarantee the
        formation of magma oceans on moons or planetary bodies. Authors and

        Technologies are becoming increasingly complicated and increasingly
        interconnected. Cars, airplanes, medical devices, financial
        transactions, and electricity systems all rely on more computer software
        than they ever have before, making them seem both harder to understand
        and, in some cases, harder to control. Government and corporate
        surveillance of individuals and information processing relies largely on
        digital technologies and artificial intelligence, and therefore involves
        less human-to-human contact than ever before and more opportunities for
        biases to be embedded and codified in our technological systems in ways
        we may not even be able to identify or recognize. Bioengineering
        advances are opening up new terrain for challenging philosophical,
        political, and economic questions regarding human-natural relations.
        Additionally, the management of these large and small devices and
        systems is increasingly done through the cloud, so that control over
        them is both very remote and removed from direct human or social
        control. The study of how to make technologies like artificial
        intelligence or the Internet of Things “explainable” has become its own
        area of research because it is so difficult to understand how they work
        or what is at fault when something goes wrong (Gunning and Aha 2019).
        This growing complexity makes it more difficult than ever—and more
        imperative than ever—for scholars to probe how technological
        advancements are altering life around the world in both positive and
        negative ways and what social, political, and legal tools are needed to
        help shape the development and design of technology in beneficial
        directions. This can seem like an impossible task in light of the rapid
        pace of technological change and the sense that its continued
        advancement is inevitable, but many countries around the world are only
        just beginning to take significant steps toward regulating computer
        technologies and are still in the process of radically rethinking the
        rules governing global data flows and exchange of technology across
        borders. These are exciting times not just for technological development
        but also for technology policy—our technologies may be more advanced and
        complicated than ever but so, too, are our understandings of how they
        can best be leveraged, protected, and even constrained. The structures
        of technological systems as determined largely by government and
        institutional policies and those structures have tremendous implications
        for social organization and agency, ranging from open source, open
        systems that are highly distributed and decentralized, to those that are
        tightly controlled and closed, structured according to stricter and more
        hierarchical models. And just as our understanding of the governance of
        technology is developing in new and interesting ways, so, too, is our
        understanding of the social, cultural, environmental, and political
        dimensions of emerging technologies. We are realizing both the
        challenges and the importance of mapping out the full range of ways that
        technology is changing our society, what we want those changes to look
        like, and what tools we have to try to influence and guide those shifts.
        Promises and Pitfalls of Technology Technology can be a source of
        tremendous optimism. It can help overcome some of the greatest
        challenges our society faces, including climate change, famine, and
        disease. For those who believe in the power of innovation and the
        promise of creative destruction to advance economic development and lead
        to better quality of life, technology is a vital economic driver
        (Schumpeter 1942). But it can also be a tool of tremendous fear and
        oppression, embedding biases in automated decision-making processes and
        information-processing algorithms, exacerbating economic and social
        inequalities within and between countries to a staggering degree, or
        creating new weapons and avenues for attack unlike any we have had to
        face in the past. Scholars have even contended that the emergence of the
        term technology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries marked a shift
        from viewing individual pieces of machinery as a means to achieving
        political and social progress to the more dangerous, or hazardous, view
        that larger-scale, more complex technological systems were a
        semiautonomous form of progress in and of themselves (Marx 2010). More
        recently, technologists have sharply criticized what they view as a wave
        of new Luddites, people intent on slowing the development of technology
        and turning back the clock on innovation as a means of mitigating the
        societal impacts of technological change (Marlowe 1970). At the heart of
        fights over new technologies and their resulting global changes are
        often two conflicting visions of technology: a fundamentally optimistic
        one that believes humans use it as a tool to achieve greater goals, and
        a fundamentally pessimistic one that holds that technological systems
        have reached a point beyond our control. Technology philosophers have
        argued that neither of these views is wholly accurate and that a purely
        optimistic or pessimistic view of technology is insufficient to capture
        the nuances and complexity of our relationship to technology (Oberdiek
        and Tiles 1995). Understanding technology and how we can make better
        decisions about designing, deploying, and refining it requires capturing
        that nuance and complexity through in-depth analysis of the impacts of
        different technological advancements and the ways they have played out
        in all their complicated and controversial messiness across the world.
        These impacts are often unpredictable as technologies are adopted in new
        contexts and come to be used in ways that sometimes diverge
        significantly from the use cases envisioned by their designers. The
        internet, designed to help transmit information between computer
        networks, became a crucial vehicle for commerce, introducing unexpected
        avenues for crime and financial fraud. Social media platforms like
        Facebook and Twitter, designed to connect friends and families through
        sharing photographs and life updates, became focal points of election
        controversies and political influence. Cryptocurrencies, originally
        intended as a means of decentralized digital cash, have become a
        significant environmental hazard as more and more computing resources
        are devoted to mining these forms of virtual money. One of the crucial
        challenges in this area is therefore recognizing, documenting, and even
        anticipating some of these unexpected consequences and providing
        mechanisms to technologists for how to think through the impacts of
        their work, as well as possible other paths to different outcomes
        (Verbeek 2006). And just as technological innovations can cause
        unexpected harm, they can also bring about extraordinary benefits—new
        vaccines and medicines to address global pandemics and save thousands of
        lives, new sources of energy that can drastically reduce emissions and
        help combat climate change, new modes of education that can reach people
        who would otherwise have no access to schooling. Regulating technology
        therefore requires a careful balance of mitigating risks without overly
        restricting potentially beneficial innovations. Politics and Privacy
        Nations around the world have taken very different approaches to
        governing emerging technologies and have adopted a range of different
        technologies themselves in pursuit of more modern governance structures
        and processes (Braman 2009). In Europe, the precautionary principle has
        guided much more anticipatory regulation aimed at addressing the risks
        presented by technologies even before they are fully realized. For
        instance, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation
        focuses on the responsibilities of data controllers and processors to
        provide individuals with access to their data and information about how
        that data is being used not just as a means of addressing existing
        security and privacy threats, such as data breaches, but also to protect
        against future developments and uses of that data for artificial
        intelligence and automated decision-making purposes. In Germany,
        Technische Überwachungsvereine, or TÜVs, perform regular tests and
        inspections of technological systems to assess and minimize risks over
        time, as the tech landscape evolves. In the United States, by contrast,
        there is much greater reliance on litigation and liability regimes to
        address safety and security failings after-the-fact. These different
        approaches reflect not just the different legal and regulatory
        mechanisms and philosophies of different nations but also the different
        ways those nations prioritize rapid development of the technology
        industry versus safety, security, and individual control. Typically,
        governance innovations move much more slowly than technological
        innovations, and regulations can lag years, or even decades, behind the
        technologies they aim to govern. In addition to this varied set of
        national regulatory approaches, a variety of international and
        nongovernmental organizations also contribute to the process of
        developing standards, rules, and norms for new technologies, including
        the International Organization for Standardization­ and the
        International Telecommunication Union. These multilateral and NGO actors
        play an especially important role in trying to define appropriate
        boundaries for the use of new technologies by governments as instruments
        of control for the state. At the same time that policymakers are under
        scrutiny both for their decisions about how to regulate technology as
        well as their decisions about how and when to adopt technologies like
        facial recognition themselves, technology firms and designers have also
        come under increasing criticism. Growing recognition that the design of
        technologies can have far-reaching social and political implications
        means that there is more pressure on technologists to take into
        consideration the consequences of their decisions early on in the design
        process (Vincenti 1993; Winner 1980). The question of how technologists
        should incorporate these social dimensions into their design and
        development processes is an old one, and debate on these issues dates
        back to the 1970s, but it remains an urgent and often overlooked part of
        the puzzle because so many of the supposedly systematic mechanisms for
        assessing the impacts of new technologies in both the private and public
        sectors are primarily bureaucratic, symbolic processes rather than
        carrying any real weight or influence.
